<Step>
## Install & Explore

No global install is requiredâ€”run commands with NPX and Node.js 18+. The CLI pulls the latest component data from the Nocta registry, so make sure you have network access when you execute commands.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx nocta-ui --help
```
</Step>

<Step>
## Initialize Your Project

Set up configuration, Tailwind tokens, and baseline utilities in one step. The initializer validates your framework (Next.js, Vite + React, or React Router 7), ensures Tailwind CSS v4 is present, installs required runtime packages, and creates `nocta.config.json` tailored to your project layout.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx nocta-ui init
```
</Step>

<Step>
## Discover Components

Browse the registry directly from your project. Components are grouped by category with descriptions, variants, and size information so you can decide what to install.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx nocta-ui list
```
</Step>

<Step>
## Add UI Building Blocks

Install one or many components at once. The CLI resolves internal dependencies, writes files into the alias defined by `nocta.config.json`, normalizes imports (`@/` or `~/`), and installs any missing npm packages. If target files already exist, you will be asked whether to overwrite them.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx nocta-ui add button card badge
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Command Reference

### `init`
- Detects supported frameworks: Next.js (App or Pages Router), Vite + React, or React Router 7 (Framework Mode)
- Requires Tailwind CSS v4 and optionally upgrades guidance if an older version is found
- Writes `nocta.config.json` with defaults for `tailwind.css`, component, and utility aliases
- Downloads shared utilities (`lib/utils.ts`) and base `icons.ts` from the registry
- Injects Nocta design tokens into the configured Tailwind CSS entry file (`@import "tailwindcss"` is preserved)
- Installs core dependencies: `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, `@ariakit/react`, `@radix-ui/react-icons`
- Rolls back created files if initialization fails partway through

### `list`
- Fetches the live component catalog from `https://nocta-ui.com/registry`
- Prints categories with descriptions and every component's summary
- Shows available variants and sizes where provided
- Suggests `npx nocta-ui add <name>` for quick follow-up installation

### `add <components...>`
- Requires a valid `nocta.config.json` generated by `init`
- Accepts multiple component names; nested dependencies are fetched automatically
- Normalizes import aliases to `@/` (Next.js, Vite) or `~/` (React Router 7)
- Prompts before overwriting existing files in your component folder
- Installs missing npm dependencies and reports satisfied or updated versions
- Prints created file paths plus ready-to-copy import statements, variants, and size options

## Configuration

`nocta.config.json` controls where files are written and which CSS file receives design tokens. Edit it if your project uses custom folders.

```json5 lineNumbers title="nocta.config.json"
{
  "style": "default",
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "app/globals.css" // Next.js App Router default; other frameworks use their own paths
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "components", // components/ui/* files are written here
    "utils": "lib/utils"       // shared utility helpers live here
  }
}
```

- For Vite + React projects the defaults resolve to `src/App.css`, `src/components`, and `src/lib/utils`
- For React Router 7 (framework mode) the defaults resolve to `app/app.css`, `app/components`, and `app/lib/utils`
- Change `aliases.components` if you want files placed elsewhere; the CLI always writes into `<alias>/ui/`

## Networking & Requirements

- The CLI needs internet access to download the registry, component source files, and design tokens
- Tailwind CSS v4 must already be installed and present in `node_modules`
- React 18+ is expected; the dependency checker warns when required versions are missing or outdated
- The installer respects your package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`) by detecting existing lockfiles

With the CLI in place you can script installations, scaffold component collections, and keep projects aligned with the latest Nocta UI releases without leaving your terminal.
