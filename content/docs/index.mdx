## Overview

Nocta UI is a React component library built with a **copy-paste philosophy**.  
Instead of shipping as a heavy package, it provides source code you add directly to your project.  
This gives you **full control**, easy customization, and no versioning headaches.

## Core Principles

- **Minimal** – clean, purposeful components  
- **Performant** – lightweight and dependency-conscious  
- **Accessible** – WCAG-compliant, keyboard-friendly, screen reader ready  
- **Developer First** – TypeScript, intuitive APIs, and strong docs  

## Why Nocta UI?

- Own the code, modify freely  
- Works seamlessly with Next.js, Vite, and React Router  
- Multiple built-in themes to kickstart your design  
- Composable by design: build complex UIs from simple parts  

## Getting Started

Install the CLI and add components to your project:

```bash
npx nocta-ui init
npx nocta-ui add button card badge
